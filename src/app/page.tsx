          backend by node.js, and I write a little bit about programming and

          Actually, I only have a high school degree because i started a
          business in college and did not concentrate on my studies, which
          resulted in my failure to graduate. I started to learn programming in
          2016, and I have been working as a front-end engineer since 2017. I
          have been working in the field of front-end development for more than
          6 years.
